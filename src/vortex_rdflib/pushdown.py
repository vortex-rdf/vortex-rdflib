"""SPARQL BGP pushdown for :class:`~vortex_rdflib.store.VortexStore`.

rdflib's default ``evalBGP`` is a nested-loop join that calls
``Store.triples()`` once per candidate binding, and every one of those calls
pays the native match floor. This module registers a ``CUSTOM_EVALS`` hook
that evaluates a whole basic graph pattern against a VortexStore in one
pass instead:

- every triple pattern is matched natively exactly once, returning u32
  term-code columns (``match_codes``);
- the join runs in code space — hash joins over ``int`` tuples, no term
  strings, no rdflib term construction for intermediate results;
- terms are decoded only for the final solutions, each distinct code once,
  through the store's decode cache.

The hook applies only when the active graph's store is a VortexStore with
the code path available (Dictionary layout, resident dictionary); anything
else — other stores, other algebra nodes, RDF-star patterns — raises
``NotImplementedError``, which makes rdflib fall through to its default
evaluator. Behavior is therefore identical to the default path, only faster.

Registration happens automatically when the first ``VortexStore`` is
constructed; set ``VORTEX_RDF_DISABLE_PUSHDOWN=1`` to keep the default
evaluator (e.g. for A/B benchmarking).
